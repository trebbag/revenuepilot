Placeholder functions for audio transcription and speaker diarisation.

RevenuePilot may eventually support uploading or recording visit audio and
extracting separate transcripts for the provider and patient.  Full
implementation requires external libraries and models (e.g. pyannote.audio
for speaker diarisation and OpenAI Whisper for transcription).  Because
those dependencies cannot be installed in this environment, these
functions act as stubs.  They show the expected interface and return
empty transcripts.  Replace the bodies with calls to your chosen
speech‑to‑text and speaker separation services.

def diarize_and_transcribe(audio_bytes: bytes) -> Dict[str, str]:

    Separate speakers and transcribe the audio.  The returned dictionary
    should map speaker roles (e.g. "provider", "patient") to their
    respective transcripts.  In this stub implementation, both
    transcripts are empty.  In production, you could use a library
    like pyannote.audio to segment the audio by speaker and then feed
    each segment into a transcription model like OpenAI Whisper or
    Google Cloud Speech‑to‑Text.

    Args:
        audio_bytes: Raw audio data (e.g. from a WebM or WAV file).
    Returns:
        A dictionary with keys 'provider' and 'patient' containing
        transcribed text.
