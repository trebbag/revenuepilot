CHIEF COMPLAINT: Persistent cough for 2 weeks

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 45-year-old established patient who presents with a chief complaint of persistent dry cough lasting approximately 2 weeks. The cough is mostly nonproductive but occasionally brings up small amounts of clear mucus. Patient reports mild dyspnea on exertion, particularly when climbing stairs. Denies fever, chills, or weight loss. Cough seems worse in the morning hours.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Respiratory: Positive for cough and mild dyspnea on exertion. Negative for chest pain, wheezing, or hemoptysis.
Cardiovascular: Negative for chest pain, palpitations, or syncope.
Constitutional: Negative for fever, chills, night sweats, or unintentional weight loss.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital Signs: BP 118/76, HR 72, RR 16, Temp 98.6°F, O2 Sat 98% on room air
General: Alert, oriented, in no acute distress
Respiratory: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs
ENT: Mild erythema of posterior pharynx

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1. Acute upper respiratory infection (J06.9) - likely viral etiology given clear lungs and absence of fever
2. Acute pharyngitis (J02.9) - mild erythema noted on examination
3. Immunization encounter (Z23) - administered influenza vaccine per patient request

The patient was counseled on supportive care measures including rest, hydration, and symptomatic treatment. Return if symptoms worsen or persist beyond 7-10 days.
