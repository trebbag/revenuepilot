# Documentation Archive

This folder preserves historical planning artefacts for context. The
files are not maintained and may describe legacy assumptions that differ
from the current implementation documented in `../README.md` and
`../ARCHITECTURE.md`.

- `BACKEND_DATA_INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md` – Early audit of frontend
  elements needing backend data.
- `BACKEND_DATA_SPECIFICATION_FINALIZATION.md` – Initial data-contract
  proposals for the finalisation workflow.
- `CHAT_ARCHIVE.md` – Distillation of the original founder planning
  conversations.

Do not treat these documents as requirements; they exist solely to
capture the evolution of the product.
